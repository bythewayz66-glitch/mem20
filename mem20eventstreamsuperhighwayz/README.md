# RM-074 — Event Stream Superhighway

**Outcome:** Route high-volume typed events across local, edge, and cloud runtimes
**Breakthrough:** Every product can react to live data without custom plumbing
**Version:** 4.0.0 · **Subsystem:** `mem20eventstreamsuperhighwayz`

The superhighway is the transport layer of the mem20 estate. It routes typed
events, tracks per-subscriber offsets and lag, and — since 4.0 — it is wired
into the substrate rather than standing alone: every routed event can be
persisted to durable memory, searched multi-hop, announced to the fleet
gateway, verified for ledger integrity, and compacted for the wire.

## Install

mem20 is **not on PyPI**. Install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bythewayz66-glitch/mem20.git
cd mem20
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick start — runnable example

This is the whole seam in one script: publish an event, persist it, announce it
to the fleet, read it back, and report on the stream. Run it from the repo root.

```bash
cd mem20
MEM20_STORE_PATH=/tmp/mem20-demo-store python3 - <<'PY'
import json, sys
sys.path.insert(0, "mem20eventstreamsuperhighwayz")

from mem20eventstreamsuperhighwayz import domain, integration

stream = domain.create_stream("orders")
domain.subscribe(stream, "billing")

out = integration.publish_and_persist(
    stream, "order.created", {"id": 7, "total": 42.5}, key="o-7"
)
print("event seq      :", out["event"]["seq"])
print("memory topic   :", out["memory_topic"])
print("announced by   :", out["announced"]["agent_name"])

rows = integration.recall_events("orders", "order.created")
print("recalled rows  :", len(rows))
print("recalled body  :", json.loads(rows[0]["content"])["payload"])

report = integration.stream_report(stream)
print("throughput/min :", report["throughput_per_min"])
print("lag            :", report["lag"])
print("inventory total:", report["inventory"]["total"])
PY
```

Real output from a run of the block above:

```
event seq      : 1
memory topic   : eventstream.orders.order.created
announced by   : eventstream-orders
recalled rows  : 1
recalled body  : {'id': 7, 'total': 42.5}
throughput/min : 1.0
lag            : {'billing': 1}
inventory total: 312
```

## CLI

```bash
# publish + persist + announce
python3 -m mem20eventstreamsuperhighwayz publish \
    --stream orders --type order.created --payload '{"id": 7}' --key o-7

# operational report (stream + substrate in one object)
python3 -m mem20eventstreamsuperhighwayz report --stream orders --subscriber billing

# round-trip the memory engine and exit non-zero if the ledger is unfaithful
python3 -m mem20eventstreamsuperhighwayz verify

# measured estate inventory counts
python3 -m mem20eventstreamsuperhighwayz inventory

# multi-hop search over the event log
python3 -m mem20eventstreamsuperhighwayz search \
    "what is the p95 latency and which partition is hot"

# quantize a numeric payload for the wire
python3 -m mem20eventstreamsuperhighwayz compact 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 --bits 8
```

## MCP tools

Registered on the mem20 MCP server (`mcp/server.py` → `EventStreamToolsMixin`):

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `stream_publish` | Publish, persist and announce one event; returns the memory id |
| `stream_report` | Stream health + substrate health in one call |
| `stream_recall` | Read back persisted events for a stream/type |
| `stream_verify` | Round-trip the memory engine, report ledger fidelity |
| `stream_search` | Decompose a compound telemetry question into sub-retrievals |

## Estate wiring (criterion 6)

Every one of these is a real call on a tested path — see
`mem20eventstreamsuperhighwayz/tests/test_integration.py`.

| mem20 project | API used | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_engine` | `memory.remember` / `memory.recall` / `memory.status` | `integration.remember_event`, `recall_events`, `memory_status` |
| `memory_engine` | `retrieval_v2.decompose_query` | `integration.search_events` |
| `toolchest` | `catalog.load_inventory` | `integration.capability_inventory` |
| `gateway` | `hermes_gateway.broadcast` / `register_agent` / `load_names` | `integration.announce` |
| `mem20verify` | `dataintegrity.check` | `integration.verify_memory_integrity` |
| `mem20ops` | `memchecks.identity_check` | `integration.identity_report` |
| `mem20corez` | `quantizer.quantize_tensor` | `integration.compact_payload` |

### Two estate traps this subsystem has to handle

Both are real and both are documented in `_bootstrap.py` rather than papered
over:

1. **Shim shadowing.** `mem20corez/__init__.py` is a version-only shim sitting
   next to the real package at `mem20corez/mem20corez/`. With the repo root on
   `sys.path`, `import mem20corez` resolves to the shim and `quantizer` is
   unreachable. `_bootstrap.ensure_estate_path()` puts the inner package parent
   ahead of the repo root and evicts an already-imported shim.
2. **`memory` shim vs engine.** The repo root ships a `memory.py` that
   re-exports `memory_engine.memory`. `mem20verify.dataintegrity.check()`
   rebinds `ENTRIES`/`LEDGER` on whatever `import memory` returns, so if the
   shim wins, the rebinding lands on the shim and the check reports 0
   round-trips while looking like a data-integrity failure.
   `verify_memory_integrity()` binds the real engine module first.
